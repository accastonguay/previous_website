# Urban water transitions

The main focus of my research is to look into policies than can enable urban water management transition, that is to make urban water management more resilient, adaptive and water sensitive. 
The method that was chosen to look into these policies is through agent-based modelling, by simulating the behavior of stakeholders as decentralised agents and by defining their objectives and decision rules.
A part of the research is to evaluate the effectiveness policies in influencing the behavior of households, for example to increase water tariffs to increase the uptake if private water technologies.
   
The model is developed and tested in the Scotchman's Creek catchment, in the southeast part of Melbourne.

The second part of the research consists of simulating the investment in public water technologies, most often from city councils, or local governments.
This is challenging since the behavior is likely to change from one council to another and multiple decision rules are to be developped.

# Application of the model in Indonesia

The model developped in Melbourne will then be adapted to be applied in the city of Bogor, Indonesia.
