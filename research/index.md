# Urban water transitions

The main focus of my research is to develop a model to inform policies to promote the uptake of nature-based solutions for stormwater management and ultimately, enable urban water management transition. 
The model uses an agent-based approach, by simulating the decision-making process and behavior of stakeholders as actors or agents of the stormwater management system.
   
The model is applied in various locations across the southeast part of Melbournend, which include Scotchman's Creek catchment, Elwood catchment and the City of Kingston.

<!--
The second part of the research consists of simulating the investment in public water technologies, most often from city councils, or local governments.
This is challenging since the behavior is likely to change from one council to another and multiple decision rules are to be developped.

#  Application of the model in Indonesia

The model developped in Melbourne will then be adapted to be applied in the city of Bogor, Indonesia.
